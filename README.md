# pygenesis
A random generator for use with a rewritten version of MicroLite20 I worked up called WarLite20,
that focuses on wargaming and army building but still allows for tabletop roleplaying like other
d20 systems. The goal for the project is to have a on hand python app that will allow players of
any RPG system to generate random content on the fly when in a pinch, or looking to start a fresh
campaign.

# Intro
This is my first full size project on GitHub! Yay, I feel like a shit head because it's just a bunch of if and print statements.
FML. Anyways, if anyone is interested in helping out the development and maybe linking up on discord for a game of WarLite20 that would be cool too! :3

A copy of the WarLite20 Core Rulebook will be added here to the repo as well.

## TODO
1. Alot.
2. Get a better way to store the list information, maybe setup something with sqlite3. (It's already pretty ridiculous.)
3. Make a better way to handle unique colorization for certain aspects. (Population being one, item rarity another.)
4. Stop being ashamed of learning.

# Structure
Right now it's a flat file that pulls from another conf.py file. main.py and conf.py are the two major pieces at the moment. I might again depending on the tasks to do, setup an sql schema and get some tables fleshed out and load them with sqlite.. 
Someone help me lol.
